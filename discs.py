#The code first cleans the data by removing unnecessary columns and replacing spaces in column names. It then performs a series of analyses on the data, including finding the most popular tracks, books, and luxury items chosen by guests, as well as comparing the choices of returning guests. The code also uses the gender_guesser library to guess the gender of each guest based on their first name and explore the gender differences in guestsâ€™ choices. Overall, this project provides insights into the preferences of Desert Island Discs guests and how they have changed over time.
