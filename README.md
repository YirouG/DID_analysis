# Desert Island Discs Data Analysis Project


## Introduction

The Desert Island Discs(DID) archive is a rich source of data on the music preferences of guests on the BBC radio show of the same name. Since its inception in 1942, the show has invited over 3,000 guests to select the eight records they would take with them to a desert island. Although castaways only started choosing books and luxuries regularly in the late 1950s, the scale of the data associated with the program is huge. These records provide insight into the musical tastes and preferences of the guests and can be analyzed to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.

In past research on the Desert Island Discs program, the focus has been mainly on two directions. One approach is to view the conversations in the broadcast program as a corpus and conduct a sociolinguistic analysis. The other approach is to extract formatted guest names, broadcast dates, record selections, and other information from each episode and conduct data analysis, discussing the social context and impact of the program. This project mainly focuses on a descriptive summary of the latest data on the occasion of the program's 80th anniversary.

The goal of this data analysis project is to first describe the preferences of guests in general, then find out the pattern of guests returning, and explore the relationship between a guest's gender and the music they choose for the show. Overall, this project provides insights into the preferences of Desert Island Discs guests and how they have changed over time.

## Methods

The data for this project was collected from the Desert Island Discs archive, which is available online at the BBC website (https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr/episodes/player). The data includes the names and occupations of guests, as well as the titles, artists, and genres of the records they selected for their desert island discs. The dataset used in this analysis was generated by Praful Kapadia and is available at https://prafulkapadia.com/2020/02/04/desert-island-discs-all-the-records-books-and-luxuries/.

To collect the data, all episodes of the show from 1942 to 2022 were searched and the relevant information was extracted for each guest. This included the guest's name, occupation, and the titles and artists of the records they chose. The data was then cleaned and organized into a structured format for analysis.

The code first cleans the data by removing unnecessary columns and replacing spaces in column names. It then performs a series of analyses on the data, including finding the most popular tracks, books, and luxury items chosen by guests, as well as comparing the choices of returning guests. The code also uses the gender_guesser library to guess the gender of each guest based on their first name and explore the gender differences in guestsâ€™ choices. Overall, this project provides insights into the preferences of Desert Island Discs guests and how they have changed over time.
